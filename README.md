## Development conditions
SATE was built during a hackathon (McHacks) and was developed in less than 24 hours.

## Inspiration
The goal was to build an app to help out friends by making the process of selecting a restaurant a lot easier. 

## What it does
What **SATE** does is it communicates with the user and adjusts its results until the user is satisfied with a selection. A user enters their desired cravings and **SATE** returns relevant results based on key words in the user's query. If no food words are seen, **SATE** opens its mind up to the user and allows users to teach it new food words. This way **SATE** has an ever growing database of food words.

## How we built it
We built **SATE** using the MEAN Stack (Mongodb, Expressjs, Angular, Node.js). The server (written in Node.js) is hosted with AWS and the mobile app is a hybrid app built using Ionic. 

## Challenges we ran into
* Adding voice to text functionality (partially working)
* Wifi issues
* Time restrictions therefore hard to implement new technologies
* Deployment

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The main functionality of **SATE** works and works well. Now that it is up and running, everyone on our team agrees that it would be a useful tool in everyday life. 

## What we learned
* Teamwork
* Software development flow
* Business side of things

## What's next for SATE
* Completing voice to text is the main goal
* Fully deploying the front-end (app-store and domain)
